# Perspectives on Digital Sovereignty

This Part will:

1. explore scholarly perspectives on the application of sovereignty to cyberspace; and
2. explore state practice in this regard, too.

It will become clear that both scholarship and state practice concerning the relationship between sovereignty and cyberspace are in a state of confusion, as sovereignty, a square peg, does not fit the "round hole" of cyberspace realities.

## Scholarly Perspectives

Two main branches of legal scholarship examine sovereignty's application to cyberspace, with surprisingly few intersections betwixt the twain.

Three generations of internet law scholars have explored the effects of applying sovereignty online on the future of the internet. Most such scholars use  "sovereignty" to discuss the exercise of state authority over the online sphere in general terms, rather than using “sovereignty” in the manner that international legal scholars use the term. Such scholarship often reflects the normative commitments of the (English-speaking) internet law academy (of which I am a card-carrying member) that a free and open global internet is a _summum bonum,_ and is consistent with the policy interests of foreign ministries in most democratic states in promoting the same. 

Meanwhile, international legal scholars have focused on the application of sovereignty online principally in the context of cyberwarfare and other cyber operations, such as digital espionage. Many of these scholars have defense backgrounds reflect the policy priorities of defense ministries in their work. However, their _déformation professionelle_ leads them to overlooks the implications of extending territorial sovereignty to the peaceful uses of cyberspace, which constitute the vast majority of internet traffic. 

### Three Generations of Internet Law Scholarship

#### Generation the First

The _first_ generation of scholarship was focused on exploring whether cyberspace was a realm beyond the state. This was in the heady days of the early 1990s when we believed that the technical nature of the internet made it well-nigh impossible for states to regulate the internet. The zeitgeist is well-illustrated by the classic _New Yorker_ cartoon reproduced below. After all, if people on the Internet can't tell whether you are a dog, how can they tell who you are and where you are for the purposes of enforcing national law?

In the argot of international law, one could say that this early generation of scholarship focused on whether cyberspace was a _res nullius._ The answer to this question was a resounding “no.” Not only did governments apply and enforce existing laws to online activity, they also developed new legal doctrines to regulate online activities in a wide range of fields—from special doctrines of immunity for online service providers[^1] to new criminal prohibitions on activities such as the non-consensual sharing of intimate imagery. Furthermore, governments asserted their authority over the internet by modifying its architecture. This is exemplified by China’s early efforts to build a “Great Firewall” to keep certain internet content out of its borders.[^2]

Scholars of this generation adopted what Orin Kerr calls the “external perspective” of the internet[^3] in thinking of the application of sovereignty and its jurisdictional corollaries online. The work of Goldsmith and Wu exemplifies these views.[^4] The core of their reasoning as to the application of sovereignty online is that the infrastructure that makes up the internet—the “series of tubes” in the evocative phrase of the late Senator Ted Stevens—are located on the soil of specific States.[^5] Hence while the notion of a borderless cyberspace might be attractive to some, their view of the reality of cyberspace is that it is necessarily subject to sovereignty because of the physicality of its infrastructure.

#### Generation the Second

The second generation of internet law scholarship, which emerged in the early 2000s and was in ascendance until the end of the last decade, was focused the assertion by states of their jurisdiction online. These scholars mostly accepted the premise that sovereignty applies to the online sphere. Correspondingly, the focus of this research was on how and when the four widely recognized exceptions to the territoriality principle can and should be applied to online activities.

Scholars of this generation grappled with the interconnected nature of the internet, and the frequent difficulty of applying the territoriality principle as a “baseline”[^6] for determining whose law should apply in cyberspace. Jennifer Daskal’s _The Un-Territoriality of Data_[^7] and Andrew Keane Woods’s _Against Data Exceptionalism_[^8] represent the apotheosis of this generation of scholarship in their careful consideration of the application of sovereignty and territoriality to the problem of government access to “data at rest.” Many other works of this generation also grappled with when and how the four principal exceptions to territoriality should be applied in the online sphere, and whether certain assertions of jurisdiction should be properly viewed as extraterritorial—or not. This is consistent with Brownlie and Crawford’s prescient observation that “what amounts to extraterritorial jurisdiction is increasingly a matter of appreciation.”[^9]]

Such scholars were working in the shadow of at least _four_ cases and controversies that impacted contemporaneous thinking about the nature of sovereignty and jurisdiction online. 


_First _ is the _Yahoo France_ case, which arose in 2000 when two French NGOs sued Yahoo in the French courts for offering Nazi paraphernalia for sale on its auctions site in violation of French laws. Yahoo argued that the French courts did not possess jurisdiction over Yahoo as an entity or the subject matter of the case because it was an American company operating a service from servers located in the United States.[^10] The French courts found these arguments unavailing, and issued a fine and an injunction against Yahoo requiring the company to take all available measures to prevent French Internet users from accessing the Nazi paraphernalia featured on its auction site.[^11]

_Second_ is the _Shi Tao_ affair, which arose in 2004 when Yahoo's Chinese subsidiary acceded to an order from the Chinese state security services requiring it to turn over the contents of an anonymous email account.[^12] The account turned out to belong to Shi Tao, a journalist employed at a state-run newspaper who had used the anonymous Yahoo account to forward a government directive banning news reporting on commemorations of the Tiananmen Square massacre to foreign human rights organizations. The contents of the anonymous account were ultimately used to try and convict Shi of espionage. 

Yahoo's actions provoked an outcry throughout the democratic world. At a hearing into Yahoo's conduct by the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Rep. Tom Lantos of California—the Committee chair and a Holocaust survivor—chastised Yahoo's senior management team as a bunch of "moral pygmies." For its part, Yahoo maintained that it had no choice but to comply with the Chinese government order, given that the company had built infrastructure in the country that was clearly subject to Chinese law. This, in turn, led Yahoo and other leading internet companies of the day to relocate their infrastructure outside of “difficult jurisdictions” such as China, and to embrace geoblocking as a technology to respond to national legal requirements while continuing to operate a global service.

_Third_ is the _Equustek_ case in Canada, under which the Canadian courts granted a worldwide injunction requiring Google to stop returning search results for a product that allegedly misappropriated Equustek’s proprietary technologies. Google argued that it search service was beyond the reach of the Canadian courts and that the granting of a worldwide injunction might provoke a “race to the bottom” and empower other countries to enjoin online conduct that they found undesirable on a worldwide basis. The Canadian courts found these arguments unavailing in view of Google’s significant business operations in Canada and the subject matter of the case, which was about the theft of intellectual property rather than anything that implicates free expression interests. Correspondingly, the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the lower court’s grant of a worldwide injunction.

_Fourth_ is the _Microsoft Ireland_ imbroglio, which arose from a search warrant issued by a federal magistrate judge in Manhattan requiring Microsoft to turn over the contents of a webmail account. Microsoft sought to quash the warrant on the basis that the contents of the account were stored in its data center in Ireland. Correspondingly, Microsoft argued that US courts lacked the jurisdictional competence to order the company to disclose the contents of the account. Rather, Microsoft argued that the U.S. government should seek the assistance of the Irish authorities in obtaining the emails through their bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty.

The case ultimately went all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court. At all three levels of review, the U.S. Department of Justice maintained that the execution of the search warrant would not impinge on Irish sovereignty, even if the contents of the email account were physically stored in Ireland, because Microsoft employees at its headquarters outside Seattle possessed the technical capability to retrieve the emails. Microsoft retorted that Irish law and Irish sovereignty would be violated by the court so doing, and that the physical location of the data should be determinative of which sovereign possesses the jurisdictional power to authorize a search. The case was mooted by the passage of the CLOUD Act while it was _sub judice_ before the Supreme Court, yet the dispute still highlights the contentious nature of the application of the territoriality principle (and its recognized exceptions) to the online sphere.

Some scholars of this generation sought to propose creative ways out of these thickets by refining the tests for the application of a state’s jurisdiction to online phenomena. Dan Svantesson’s work, which like Daskal’s notes the challenges around the application of the territoriality principle in the cyber realm, proposes a “legitimate interests” and “substantial connection framework,[^13] similar to the Supreme Court of Canada’s _Van Breda_ framework in private international law to delimit the appropriate metes and bounds of state jurisdiction online.[^14] While Svantesson notes that “orthodox thinking” on such questions “conflate[s] sovereignty and jurisdiction beyond what is reasonable”[^15] and that “we quite simply have to reject territorial sovereignty, at least in its strictest forms”[^16] to solve what he describes the titular “internet jurisdiction puzzle” of his book, a more complete reconsideration of the scope and nature of state authority online was beyond the research agenda of this generation of scholars.

#### Generation the Third

The third generation of scholarship emerged in the late 2010s as scholars took stock of how governments were regulating the internet in ways that were resulting in significant internet fragmentation. Some of the defining works of this generation include _Data Nationalism_ by Chander and Lê,[^17] which chronicled the various ways that governments were regulating the hitherto relatively free movement of information via the internet, and Lemley’s _The Splinternet,_ which chronicled the growing fragmentation of the different layers that make up the internet.[^18]

Much of this scholarship is both descriptive and plaintive, reflecting scholars' normative beliefs that view the trends they describe as regrettable. Although “digital sovereignty” or “data sovereignty” are used by these scholars to frame the growing trend of states enacting regulations that imperil the survival of the internet as a global network, this body of scholarship engages with international legal understandings of sovereignty less than one would expect. 

Consider the introduction to the (excellent) new edited volume by Chander and Sun, which defines digital sovereignty “to mean the application of traditional state sovereignty over the online domain, or simply “sovereignty in the digital age.””[^19] They note that they use the term “digital sovereignty” “in a descriptive way to describe efforts by governments to assert control over online activities.”[^20] Yet as will be argued below, not every assertion of control by a state should be understood as an assertion of its “sovereignty,” given that international law treats the scope and nature of state authority differently in different circumstances. 

[Acknowledge and briefly summarize the perspectives of other leading scholars of this generation, especially Woods, Xu, and Rosenzweig, that build on the second generation of scholarship to conceptualize of digital sovereignty in terms of the links that exist between the physicality and effects of cyberspace with the territory of states.]

[Also acknowledge Chander and Sun’s previous work on the “double-edged” nature of digital sovereignty in relation to human rights.]

### International Law Scholarship

_[This subsection is in its early stages and needs to be fleshed out. But hopefully this provides the gist.]_

[Meanwhile, a separate body of international legal scholarship examines the application of sovereignty and cyberspace from a security-centric perspective. This scholarship concentrates on the governance of cyber operations. It presumes that territorial sovereignty applies online and reasons from this premise. It incorporates Orin Kerr's "external perspective" by arguing that the internet's physical aspects and the location of its infrastructure and users within specific states subject cyberspace to the ordinary rules of territorial sovereignty.]

[Scholars in this field reflect ongoing debates about sovereignty's nature, debating whether it is an international law rule or a principle. The divides between these scholars often stems from their views on the normative desirability of certain cyber operations. Those advocating for states' broad freedom in cyber operations view sovereignty more as a principle than a rule, arguing that interferences with sovereignty are not _per se_ violations of international law, unless they constitute internationally wrongful acts. Conversely, others argue that sovereignty is a fundamental rule of international law rule and emphasize the role that old-fashioned territorial sovereignty can play in maintaining peace and security in the cyber era.]

[This scholarship focuses on state-centric, high-politics issues of security, largely overlooking the implications of sovereignty (as a principle or rule) for cyberspace's peaceful use—save for a hide-bound and formalistic approach to applying international human rights law in cyberspace. These issues and the resulting mismatch between traditional territorial sovereignty and the realities of cyberspace will be addressed below.]

[The dialogue between this scholarship and internet law scholarship is less robust than one would expect, since both are concerned with the application of sovereignty to the digital sphere, and both seem to assume that sovereignty in some form can and should apply there.]

[Key scholars in this field include Michael Schmitt, who has helmed the development of the _Tallinn Manual,_ but also Kristen Eichensehr, Robert Taylor, Gary Corn, Russell Buchan, and others. Duncan Hollis and Dan Svantesson form some of the primary bridges between the two bodies of scholarship.]

## State Practice

_[Same disclaimer as above: this subsection is in its early stages and needs to be fleshed out. But hopefully this provides the gist.]_

[State practice is crucial in international law as it contributes to the law’s formation, just as social conventions influence the evolution of judge-made law in common law systems. Evidence of a consistent state practice, coupled with the belief that such practice is obligatory (_opinio juris_), indicates the emergence of customary law in that area.]

[State practice regarding sovereignty and cyberspace is incoherent,  reflecting the divide between internet law scholarship, which focuses on cyberspace regulation during peacetime, and international legal scholarship, which focuses on conflict and hostilities in cyberspace (up to and including cyber warfare.] 


[One facet of state practice is seen in defense department doctrines on the permissible scope of cyber operations and in various states' declarations to intergovernmental bodies like the UN Group of Governmental Experts (GGE) regarding the relationship between sovereignty relevance to cyberspace. The majority view seems to be that sovereignty is a fundamental rule of international law and that it applies to cyberspace. States in the Global South are especially likely to embrace such rhetoric. Consider the recent communique of the African Union that espouses “pure sovereignty”[^21] in cyberspace. It states:]

> The African Union affirms that, by virtue of territorial sovereignty, any unauthorized access by a State into the ICT infrastructure located on the territory of a foreign State is unlawful. Therefore, the African Union emphasises that **the obligation to respect the territorial sovereignty of States, as it applies in cyberspace, does not include a de minimis threshold of harmful effects below which an unauthorized access by a State into the ICT infrastructure located on the territory of a foreign State would not be unlawful.**[^22]

[Another facet can be seen in the statements of foreign ministers concerning internet freedom, particularly among leading democracies. These declarations emphasize the importance of maintaining a free and global internet and limiting its regulation only to measures that are compatible with international human rights law. However, as we will see elsewhere in the paper, the applicability of international human rights law (as it stands today) to many of the most contentious internet regulatory issues is quite limited, as states only owe human rights obligations to individuals subject to their jurisdiction.]

[The 2022 “Declaration for the Future of the Internet” spearheaded by the Biden Administration and signed by 60 countries exemplifies this incoherence. The Declaration states, in relevant part, that it signatories:

> includes all partners who actively support a future for the Internet that is an open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure. We further affirm our commitment to protecting and respecting human rights online and across the digital ecosystem. Partners in this Declaration intend to work toward an environment that reinforces our democratic systems and promotes active participation of every citizen in democratic processes, secures and protects individuals’ privacy, maintains secure and reliable connectivity, resists efforts to splinter the global Internet, and promotes a free and competitive global economy.

[Now consider the position of a state like Cabo Verde or the Maldives, which endorsed the 2022 Declaration and the 2024 African Union communique. What views can we ascribe to them? How can we tell?]

[^11]:	In honor of Paul Harvey, here’s the rest of the story: Yahoo claimed that there were no technical measures at its disposal to effectuate the order of the French court, and it then filed its own lawsuit against the two French NGOs in California seeking a declaration that the French injunction was unenforceable in the United States as it violated the First Amendment. While the Federal District Court in San Francisco ruled for Yahoo, the Ninth Circuit later reversed on the basis that it did not possess personal jurisdiction over the two French NGOs.
